# Experiment 6 Logs: "Pencil ++" March 2023
Last year I wrote a TypeScript app to auto format namelists for debate tournaments in China. It is not user friendly because it's inherently a command line app. I code named it Pencil. Now, after taking a C++ class, I love C++ so I'm redoing this app in C++, hence Pencil ++. Also, sample data is removed from GitHub because it has emails, phone numbers, schools, and a lot of identifying information of children, a handful under 10. Email me if you want a sample dataset.

This actually works and could be its own repository.
