# Experiment 4 Logs: Code Name Chocolate - March 2023
`@andrlime/DebateAppFrontend` was written in React, and needs rebasing. While I will rebase some of the code within a few days of writing this, this was an experiment in doing it in something else. I reasoned that offline access could be important, and since Java is used on countless devices, I could write a replacement in Java. I used Maven, Swing, JavaFX, etc. to effectively redo a single page of the original frontend, the pairing generation page. I have since recognized the value of React Function Components, but that does not eliminate the value of this experiment. The problem at hand is too... stateful if you will... to be done in a Java app, which I think is more appropriate for relatively static apps. The fact that upon uploading a file, EVERYTHING needs to change – that enough is a reason to prefer React, Angular, or any web framework. The nail in the coffin was bad styling for tables, leading to `TableCell.java`, effectively remaking tables due to the need to have styling. Then, when these went past the end of the screen, had more sizing issues, and required like three lines of code to have padding, a border, and set font, I decided to scrap this project, but upload it anyway as an archive.
